\subsection{Bucket Sort}
\info{Bucket Sort}{2}{
  Design and implement a version of the bucket-sort algorithm for sorting a linked list of $n$ entries (for instance, a list of type \texttt{std::list<int>}) with integer keys taken from the range $[0, N − 1]$, for $N \geq 2$. The algorithm should run in $O(n + N)$ time.

\subsection{Leprechaun Simulator}
\info{Jumping Leprechauns}{3}{
  Write a program that performs a simple n-body simulation, called “Jumping Leprechauns.” This simulation involves n leprechauns, numbered $1$ to $n$. It maintains a gold value $g_i$ for each leprechaun $i$, which begins with each leprechaun starting out with a million dollars worth of gold, that is, $g_i = 1000000$ for each $i = 1,2,\ldots,n$. In addition, the simulation also maintains, for each leprechaun, $i$, a place on the horizon, which is represented as a double-precision floating point number, $x_i$. In each iteration of the simulation, the simulation processes the leprechauns in order. Processing a leprechaun $i$ during this iteration begins by computing a new place on the horizon for $i$, which is determined by the assignment
\[x_i\leftarrow x_i+rg_i\]
where $r$ is a random floating-point number between $−1$ and $1$. The leprechaun $i$ then steals half the gold from the nearest leprechauns on either side of him and adds this gold to his gold value, $g_i$. Write a program that can perform a series of iterations in this simulation for a given number, $n$, of leprechauns. You must maintain the set of horizon positions using an ordered map data structure described in this chapter.
